# AutoAdal - Automated Buff Helper

**Designed specifically for [TBC5MAN](https://tbc5man.com/) - A Unique WoW TBC Private Server**

AutoAdal is a World of Warcraft addon that automates buff application and quest handling when interacting with specific NPCs like A'dal and buff bots on the TBC5MAN server.

## üéØ What Does This Addon Do?

### **Automatic Buff Application**
- **Shift + Right-Click** on buff NPCs to automatically get your buffs
- Intelligently checks what buffs you need and applies them in the right order
- Intelligently reapplies buffs only if they are close to expiring, saving you time.

### **Smart Quest Automation**
- Automatically accepts and completes specific buff-related quests (requires Badge of Justice or Token of Achievement)
- Only processes quests you've enabled in the configuration
- Skips quests if you already have the corresponding buff

### **Bloodlust/Heroism Reset**
- Automatically resets your Bloodlust or Heroism cooldown when available

## ‚ö° Why Use AutoAdal?

- **Reduces 12+ manual clicks to get you fully buffed**
- **Perfect for combat situations** - essential when you die and get revived during a fight
- **Combat-ready buffing** - get fully buffed quickly during active combat or between pulls
- **Never miss a buff** - ensures you get all available buffs, preventing manual oversight

## üîß Quick Start

1. [Download](https://github.com/veleminf/AutoAdal-5man/releases) the addon files.
2. Place the `AutoAdal` folder into your `Interface/AddOns/` folder.
3. Log in and configure your preferences with `/aa config`.
4. Target a compatible buff NPC (like A'dal) and **hold Shift while repeatedly Right-Clicking** until the addon tells you all buffs are applied.

## ‚ö° How to Use
The core of this addon is simple: **Hold Shift and Right-Click** on a buff NPC.

Each time you do this, the addon performs one action in a specific order. You may need to click several times to get all your buffs. The addon will tell you when you have everything.

**What happens when you Shift + Right-Click?**

The addon checks for and applies missing buffs in this priority:
1.  **Class Buffs First**: Applies buffs like Prayer of Fortitude, Gift of the Wild, etc.
2.  **Shout Buffs Second**: Applies your configured shout (Battle or Commanding).
3.  **Blood Pact Third**: Applies the Blood Pact buff.
4.  **Bloodlust/Heroism Reset**: Resets your cooldown if available.
5.  **Quest Buffs (Optional)**: If you've enabled them, it will automatically accept and complete quests for powerful buffs like Songflower Serenade and Dire Maul tributes. (See configuration below).


### **Quest Buffs Automation (Optional)**
When you Shift + Right-Click on buff NPCs, the addon can also automatically handle these quests:
- **World Buff Blessing** - Grants Songflower Serenade buff (requires `Token of Achievement`)
- **Slip'kik's Savvy** - DM tribute buff (requires `Badge of Justice`)
- **Fengus' Ferocity** - DM tribute buff (requires `Badge of Justice`)  
- **Mol'dar's Moxie** - DM tribute buff (requires `Badge of Justice`)

> **Note:** Quest automation is disabled by default. Enable specific quests with `/aa quest` commands or through the configuration interface.
