# AutoAdal - Automated Buff Helper

**Designed specifically for [TBC5MAN](https://tbc5man.com/) - A Unique WoW TBC Private Server**

AutoAdal is a World of Warcraft addon that automates buff application and quest handling when interacting with specific NPCs like A'dal and buff bots on the TBC5MAN server.

## üéØ What Does This Addon Do?

### **Automatic Buff Application**
- **Shift + Right-Click** on buff NPCs to automatically get your buffs
- Intelligently checks what buffs you need and applies them in the right order
- Monitors buff duration and reapplies when they're about to expire

### **Smart Quest Automation**
- Automatically accepts and completes specific buff-related quests (requires Badge of Justice or Token of Achievement)
- Only processes quests you've enabled in the configuration
- Skips quests if you already have the corresponding buff

### **Bloodlust/Heroism Reset**
- Automatically resets your Bloodlust or Heroism cooldown when available

## ‚ö° Why Use AutoAdal?

- **Reduces 12+ manual clicks to get you fully buffed**
- **Perfect for combat situations** - essential when you die and get revived during a fight
- **Combat-ready buffing** - get fully buffed quickly during active combat or between pulls
- **Never miss a buff** - ensures you get all available buffs, preventing manual oversight

## üîß Quick Start

1. [Download](https://github.com/veleminf/AutoAdal-5man/releases) the addon files
2. Place the `AutoAdal` folder in your `Interface/AddOns/` folder
3. Configure with `/aa config`
4. Hold Shift+Right-Click on any buff NPC

## ‚ö° How it Works
### **Getting Buffs**
When you Shift + Right-Click on buff NPCs, the addon will automatically:
- Apply missing **class buffs** (Prayer of Fortitude, Greater Blessing of Kings, Gift of the Wild, etc.)
- Apply your configured **shout buff** (Battle Shout or Commanding Shout)
- Apply **Blood Pact**
- Reset Bloodlust/Heroism cooldown if it's on cooldown

### **Quest Buffs Automation (Optional)**
When you Shift + Right-Click on buff NPCs, the addon can also automatically handle these quests:
- **World Buff Blessing** - Grants Songflower Serenade buff (requires Token of Achievement)
- **Slip'kik's Savvy** - DM tribute buff (requires Badge of Justice)
- **Fengus' Ferocity** - DM tribute buff (requires Badge of Justice)  
- **Mol'dar's Moxie** - DM tribute buff (requires Badge of Justice)

> **Note:** Quest automation is disabled by default. Enable specific quests with `/aa quest` commands or through the configuration interface.

## üïí Smart Duration Checking

The addon monitors your buff durations and will reapply buffs when they're about to expire:

- **Class Buffs**: Reapplied when less than 50 minutes remaining
- **Shout Buffs**: Reapplied when less than 9 minutes remaining
- **Quest Buffs**: Reapplied when less than 15 minutes remaining

## üìã Buff Priority System

When you Shift + Right-Click, buffs are applied in this order:

1. **Class Buffs First** - If you're missing any class buff (Prayer of Fortitude, Greater Blessing of Kings, Gift of the Wild, and more...)
2. **Shout Buffs Second** - If you're missing your configured shout buff
3. **Blood Pact Third** - If you're missing Blood Pact
4. **Quest Handling Last** - Processes any enabled quest buffs

## üí¨ Smart Tooltips

When you hover over buff NPCs, AutoAdal displays intelligent tooltips that show:
- **Exact buff count** - See how many buffs that specific NPC can apply (e.g., "3 remaining")
- **NPC-specific counts** - Each NPC shows only the buffs it can provide
- **Completion status** - Shows "All buffs already applied" when fully buffed
