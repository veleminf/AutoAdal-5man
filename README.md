## üñ•Ô∏è Configuration Options

AutoAdal provides multiple ways to configure your settings:

### **Graphical Configuration Interface**

Access the standalone configuration window with:
```
/aa config
```

Or find AutoAdal in your Interface Options menu:
```
Escape ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí AddOns ‚Üí AutoAdal
```

![AutoAdal Configuration Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc3865a-40d7-4587-bb39-2a72b67c6178)

The configuration interface allows you to:
- **Enable/Disable** the addon with a simple checkbox
- **Select Shout Type** from a dropdown menu (Commanding or Battle)
- **Toggle Quest Buffs** individually with checkboxes
- All changes take effect immediately

This provides a more intuitive way to configure the addon compared to using slash commands.

- **Shout Buffs**: Reapplied when less than 9 minutes remaining
- **Quest Buffs**: Reapplied when less than 15 minutes remaining

## üìã Buff Priority System

When you Shift + Right-Click, buffs are applied in this order:

1. **Class Buffs First** - If you're missing any class buff (Prayer of Fortitude, Greater Blessing of Kings, Gift of the Wild, and more...)
2. **Shout Buffs Second** - If you're missing your configured shout buff
3. **Blood Pact Third** - If you're missing Blood Pact
4. **Quest Handling Last** - Processes any enabled quest buffs

## üí¨ Smart Tooltips

When you hover over buff NPCs, AutoAdal displays intelligent tooltips that show:
- **Exact buff count** - See how many buffs that specific NPC can apply (e.g., "3 remaining")
- **NPC-specific counts** - Each NPC shows only the buffs it can provide
- **Real-time updates** - Tooltip refreshes automatically after each Shift + Right-Click
- **Completion status** - Shows "All buffs already applied" when fully buffed
